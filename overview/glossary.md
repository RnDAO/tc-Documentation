# ðŸ“˜ Glossary

_Interaction_: Interactions are conversations between community members. Specifically every mention of someone, reply or emoji reaction is counted as an interaction. Posts without these features are "shouts in the dark", with the exception of posts within a thread. Posts within a thread are always counted as an interaction.

_Posting:_ Every message on Discord is a post. But not every post is counted as an interaction.

## Member types

**Active** members __ are members who interact at least once during a selected time frame with at least one other member. This member type is further segmented into:

* **Consistently active** members  are your regulars who keep having conversations with others, continuously sustaining the relationships. You can adjust the time period over which these members are counted. The default setting is interacting at least once per week for at least 3 out of 4 weeks.&#x20;
* **Newly active** members are members who joined and start building relationships with others within the past 7 days.&#x20;
* **Still active** are new joiners who remain active after several weeks.&#x20;
* **Vital** members are your super-connectors within your consistently active members group. On top of being consistently active, vital members are very connected and interacting with many other members. The default setting is that they have at least 5 interactions with at least 5 other members during a week, and keep up this behavior for at least 3 out of 4 consecutive weeks.

**Became disengaged** are those active members you lost as they have not interacted with anyone during a specified time period (default value is 2 weeks after last activity). To help you better understand what type of member you are losing, we show the previous member type a disengaged member was part of (newly active, consistently active, vital member)

**Joined** members **** are members who joined in the last 7 days.

**Returned** members are a special inactive-then-active group. These are community members who became disengaged but decided to come back and re-engage with the community.

## Health Metrics

**Spread of Influence** (available soon) shows how much conversations depend on one (or very few) key members. Influence exists in a continuum between:

* Too spread: everyone regularly talks with everyone . Members manage too many relationships and are involved in too many divergent topics. Everyoneâ€™s voice is heard and included, but the community can struggle to define its direction and make progress.
* Too concentrated: a few core people engage with everyone, but other members don't talk to each other. The community is dependent on these key influencers, and its vision is only shaped by their opinions. This allows for speed but at the cost of buy-in and hence resilience

**Fragmentation** (available soon) shows how much members are divided into informal cliques as a continuum between:

* Too fragmented: the community is very divided. It no longer feels like one community but rather multiple, smaller disconnected siloes. This leads to a lack of collaboration and, if not addressed, diverging visions and values.
* Too enmeshed: the community is too dense and monolithic. It feels noisy and overwhelming. Likely, members are involved in too many repeating conversations about the same tasks/topics.
