# ðŸ”¢ What we do with your data

_Note: This is a simplification of our privacy_ [_policy and terms of services_](https://togethercrew.com/privacy)_. We follow GDPR rules._&#x20;

\
We are a team of scientists trained in handling sensitive, human data in an ethical and responsible way. We donâ€™t build data lakes just for the sake of greedily collecting more and more of your data. We donâ€™t sell your data to anybody. What we do is simple: Collect your community data to run analysis for you.&#x20;



## What data do we collect?

We collect two types of data: Data necessary to create an account on our website and data about your community.&#x20;

### Creating an account

Accounts on TogetherCrew have to be created by your communityâ€™s Discord admin. Only they have the necessary privileges to install our bot and give it access to the required channels. We only require a Discord username to create an account. Providing an email is optional. However, if you want to delete your account in the future, we will need your email to verify ownership of the account.

### Community data

We canâ€™t do any community analytics without data. But that does not mean that we take it all. You are in full control of what data we analyze by selecting the channels the bot has access to, and how far in the past the data is captured. When installing the bot you can see the permissions the bot has. The bot can only read message history.



## Your action

You are responsible for announcing to your community that the bot has been installed in your discord server.&#x20;



## What happens with your data

When you connect the bot to your server, the bot reads the message history and stores the data to run analysis. The dashboard will show you the results. Results are displayed in two forms:

* Anonymized data: We have metrics where itâ€™s impossible to link the number to the person. These are community metrics. For example, our decentralization metric is one.&#x20;
* Non-anonymized data: The member activity metrics connect a memberâ€™s activity status (e.g, active) to their name. \


## Will a human read your data

Your data is being analyzed by a computer program. TogetherCrewâ€™s team members will not manually log into our database to read your messages.

\


## Can I delete my data

Yes, you can. You first have to disconnect your server. This does not delete your data. It stops our bot from reading messages on your server. To delete your data, you need to write an email to [info@togethercrew.com](mailto:info@togethercrew.com) providing us with information about your discord serverâ€™s name and id. You have to write this email from the account you used when signing up to our service.&#x20;
