# Member Churn

The member retention panel begins with two important pieces of information: How many members are leaving (becoming disengaged) and how many previously disengaged members are coming back (returned). It is important to remember that members need to be inactive in the last three weeks of this data collection period to be categorised as disengaged. \


The special category of returning members gives you further insights into the value the community provides. Members might not, for various reasons, be able to continuously interact in your community. But the experience they have is positive, driving them to come back.
