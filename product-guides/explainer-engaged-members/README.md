# üë• Explainer: Member types

## Our Active Member Types: &#x20;

Active members are the ones who interact at least once during a selected time frame with at least one other member. For this report, we set the time period to 1 week. To help you better understand behaviour, we break this group up a bit more

* Consistently active members are your regulars who keep having conversations with others, continuously sustaining the relationships. You can adjust the time period over which these members are counted. The default setting is interacting at least once per week for at least 3 out of 4 weeks.&#x20;
* Vital members. Those are your super-connectors within your consistently active members group. On top of being consistently active, vital members are very connected and interacting with many other members. The default setting is that they have at least 5 interactions with at least 5 other members during a week, and keep up this behaviour for at least 3 out of 4 consecutive weeks.

## Our Inactive Member Types: These are further segregated into

* Became disengaged: Those active members you lost as they have not interacted with anyone during a specified time period (default value is 2 weeks after last activity).&#x20;
*
  * To help you better understand what type of members you are losing, we show the previous member type a disengaged member was part of (newly active, consistently active, vital member)
* Returned members: We also developed a special inactive-then-active group. These are community members who became disengaged but decided to come back and re-engage with the community.&#x20;

What can you learn from the Community Insight page?
---------------------------------------------------

1. Do your outreach activities attract sufficient new members?
2. Is your community successfully welcoming new members (newly active) and integrating them (still active)?
3. Are interactions sustained over time leading to strong relationships, the core building block of healthy communities (consistently active and vital members)?

Important here is to not only focus on the summary number for the selected time period, but to pay attention to changes. Posting on Twitter about an event should attract new people, and some of these new people should be interested to stay in your community. Use these numbers to track the impact of community events and activities. \


You can also pay attention to spikes, sudden increases in numbers. But don‚Äôt underestimate the importance of consistency and a steady flow, or increase of new members, and decrease of disengaged members. \


Changes in member types will impact the community health structure. You should look at how one influences the other.  A sudden inflow or churn of members will create perturbation. For example:

* With a sudden increase in members, cohesion might increase while new members jump between channels trying to find ‚Äútheir space‚Äù. These members jumping between channels can appear like bridges connecting different conversations, however, give them some time to settle and develop consistent interaction patterns.
* A loss of members can decrease your social decentralisation index. But whether changes in member composition also have lasting changes in the structure of the community depends on who is leaving and how new members are integrated.
