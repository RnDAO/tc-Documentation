# üçï Explainer: Fragmentation

Cohesion is a way to measure where your community is lying on the continuum between ‚Äúwe are a single unit‚Äù (low cohesion; score of 0) to ‚Äúwe are a group of several small niche sub-communities‚Äù (high cohesion; score of 200).&#x20;

### Advantage of high cohesion&#x20;

Your community has lots of specialists who have the space to do their thing with limited interference/input from others. Members can just do their work in their small sub-community without having to engage in lengthy explanations to those who lack the context to intuitively understand what needs to be done. These small sub-communities can thus move fast.&#x20;

### Advantage of low cohesion&#x20;

Your community has a lot of generalists and multi-taskers who tend to  talk with each other about everything. Members remain connected with each other and stay aligned and involved in every topic. Things move slowly as everyone‚Äôs voice is included.&#x20;

Generally, in smaller communities, the score will naturally be lower. With fewer people, there are less chances for people to only be involved in a few niche discussions. You see contributors talking about a wide range of topics and contributing to several activities (low specialisation). \


### What can you learn from the Cohesion metric

1. How much effort do you need to put into keeping everyone aligned? If the score is high , better repeat the community‚Äôs purpose often and through various means. Members might forget it while working in their own little groups. But first check how many channels you have. Conversations might just be spread too thin in your community.&#x20;
2. Are you able to innovate? If the cohesion score is low, you do not give enough space to members to specialise or focus on a specific niche product. Members with similar interests might not be able to find each other and begin a sub-community. Or the infrastructure (discord structure, decision making process) does not support members creating their own space.&#x20;
3. Feeling like Big Brother is watching you? Cohesion might be too low and people are policing each other's behaviour.
