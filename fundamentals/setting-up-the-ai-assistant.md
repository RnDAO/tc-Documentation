# ðŸŽ’ Setting up the AI assistant

The AI assistant is your community's personal intern, never tired or grumpy helping you out. Members can ask it simple questions about your product, it can summarize key points of a conversation. You can also use it to help you prepare proposals and it will make it easier for you and your members to stay up to date on conversations. Watch the video below to learn how it works and how to set it up.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you add a new platform, give HiveMind 24 hours to process new data sources.

### Integrating Discord with the AI assistant

_The AI assistant needs to know what conversations (aka channels) it can use to **learn** about your community and where it is allowed to answer questions._

* **Select** Discord in the row of platforms at the top.
* In the Learning panel (left side)
  * **Select** the starting date. This marks of far back HiveMind can go to learn about your community. You can not select a date further than 3 months back.&#x20;
  * **Select** which channels HiveMind can use to build knowledge about your community. TogetherCrew needs **read** access to those channels.
    * If you can not select the toggle for a specific channel, this means your permissions aren't set properly. Read [here](permission-settings-for-discord.md) how to do it.
* In the **Answering** plane (right side) you can select in which channels HiveMind can answer questions. The HiveMind command (`/question`) will only work in the channels that you have selected. TogetherCrew needs **write** access to those channels.&#x20;
  * If you can not select the toggle for a specific channel, this means your permissions aren't set properly. Read [here](permission-settings-for-discord.md) how to do it.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/hivemind - google drive>)

_HiveMind will know the content and metadata about your files._

* **Select** GDrive in the top row of platforms.
* Add the shared drive, folder or page ids. You can not add the connected account's personal drive, only shared drives. You can add folders and files of the connected account.
* You'll find the id of a shared drive, folder, or file in its url.
  * To add **folder ids, i**n a new tab, **open** your Google Drive and go to the folder you want HiveMind to have access to. Now in the address bar, **copy** everything after the last slash. For example the folder TogetherCrew has the url [`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4y1kMFOyu244mmhVdKym_YGAWKB4c1G`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4y1kMFOyu244mmhVdKym\_YGAWKB4c1G). I'm adding `1-4y1kMFOyu244mmhVdKym_YGAWKB4c1G` into the form field **folder id**. Press enter after you pasted the id.
  * To add **Files ids**, follow the same steps and add the id in the form field **Files ids**. The id is the string after `/d/` and the next slash `/.` Press enter after you pasted the id.
  * To add shared drive, follow the same steps. The id is the string after `/folders/`. Press enter after you pasted the id.

_HiveMind will know the content and metadata about your files._

To connect the Notion platform to the HiveMind module you need to add the specific page and database ids. You find the ids as part of the page or database url.&#x20;

* **Select** Notion in the top row of platforms.
* Now you have to  give HiveMind access to specific pages and databases. You do this by adding their id. **Open Notion** in a **browser.**
* You'll find the id of a page or database in its url.
  * To add a **Notion page**, in a new tab **open** Notion and navigate to the page you want HiveMind to have access to.&#x20;
    * Now in the address bar, **copy** the string of letters and numbers that come after the human readable string. For example, the url for RnDAO's welcome page in Notion is [`https://www.notion.so/rndadocs/Welcome-to-RnDAO-1fe31552c82a45278e7a30a8d9cb89f1`](https://www.notion.so/rndadocs/Welcome-to-RnDAO-1fe31552c82a45278e7a30a8d9cb89f1). To make this page available to HiveMind, add `1fe31552c82a45278e7a30a8d9cb89f1`.
    * Press enter after you pasted the id.
  * To add a **Notion Database**, navigate to the database you want HiveMind to have access to.&#x20;
    * From the url in the address bar, copy the string between the last slash `/` and the question mark `?`. For example, the URL for RnDAO's database of ventures is [`https://www.notion.so/rndadocs/9bb634baa80542e1adf64b8d9b0716db?v=72d1ea9cc19f4f6e876767d9e7647649`](https://www.notion.so/rndadocs/9bb634baa80542e1adf64b8d9b0716db?v=72d1ea9cc19f4f6e876767d9e7647649). The database id is `9bb634baa80542e1adf64b8d9b0716db.`
    * Press enter after you pasted the id.
