# ðŸ§‘ Community Insights

## When is the community most active?

Ever wondered when your community members are talking with each other? This chart shows you exactly on what day and time members are posting. The darker shaded a cell, the more activity in your Discord.

### Customize it!

The default setting for this chart is to show you the interaction level for the past seven days. You can change this to longer time frames (one months to one year).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We can only show what data we have. Check your [settings.md](settings.md "mention") and ask us to go further back in time by fetching even older data.
{% endhint %}

### What now?

Now that you know when your members are active, you can

* Schedule calls when members are already on Discord. But keep in mind, just because members are texting, that doesn't mean they can jump on a call.&#x20;
* See which event creates most buzz.
* Diagnose what type of announcement get members talking.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Read [explainer-community-activity-level.md](../chart-guides/explainer-community-activity-level.md "mention") to dig deeper into this feature.
{% endhint %}

## What's the next feature?

We are prototyping two new features: A breakdown of engaged and disengaged members. For each case, we have developed custom member types based on their activity level and for how long they sustain it.&#x20;
