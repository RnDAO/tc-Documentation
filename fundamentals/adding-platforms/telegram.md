# Telegram

Adding the Telegram bot to your channel only takes a couple of steps.

1. Log into www.togethercrew.com using your preferred account. Right now this will have to be Discord, but we'll have Telegram and other methods available soon.
2. If this is your first time, select **+create** at the bottom, add your community name in the text field and **create** your community. If you have logged in in the past, go ahead and select your community.&#x20;
3. Go to **Community Settings** and in the top panel select Telegram.
4. You'll see all the instructions to add our bot to your channel.
   1. Switch over to Telegram
   2. Go to your community
   3. Select **add members**
   4. Search for **TogetherCrew** **bot**, make sure you select the right one (check that it has our logo)
   5. Make the bot an admin in your community.&#x20;
   6. Go back to **Community Settings** in www.app.togethercrew.com and copy the verification code.
   7. **Paste** the verification code into your chat.&#x20;
5. The bot has been set up properly. Hivemind will start learning from your chat history. After 24 hours your dashboard will have data.

The bot will only have data from the day it has been added. It does not have access to your chat history.

The **AI Assistant** will need some time to learn about your community. It's eager to help, but within the first days, answers can be a bit general. It's like a little kid: Always ready to talk. But compared to humans, it learns super fast.&#x20;
