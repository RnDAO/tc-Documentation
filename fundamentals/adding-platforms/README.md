# üï∏Ô∏è Adding platforms

You can toggle on different modules that work on top of your data TogetherCrew is ingesting. For each module you have a choice of different platforms. Remember

* A **platform**  is any tool that you use. For example: Discord, Notion, Discourse, Github.
* A **module** is a "widget" that is offered as part of TogetherCrew For example: [HiveMind](../setting-up-the-ai-assistant.md), reputationNFT

To set up a module you always follow this flow

1. Go to **Community Settings**
2. **Select** the chosen platform
3. **Connect** the chosen platform
4. **Manage the access** a **module** should have to the **platform**

{% hint style="info" %}
When you connect a platform you make it _possible_ for other modules to pull data from these platforms. But you still need to set up these modules and tell them exactly what data to pull.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
