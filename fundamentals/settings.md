# üìù Settings

The setting page lets you change what data should be fetched. You can adapt three settings:

### Time period

Change how far back the data analysis should go. Choose between 7 days (the default), 1 month (1M), 3 months (3M), 6 months (6M), and 1 year (1Y).&#x20;

By selecting a different range, you change what historical data will be included in the dashboard. You'll see what the starting point of the analysis is.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want the charts to show a different time frame, select the filtering button at the top right. That changes the visualization without impacting the data&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Channels

Under **change your imported channels** you can select or deselect the channels you want to include in the dashboard.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Do you have role-gated channels? Give the bot permission to access them. Go to your server settings in Discord and add the corresponding roles to the bot.
{% endhint %}



## Integration

Here you can see your integrations. Right now you can only integrate the bot in one community. **Disconnect** the bot, if you want it to stop fetching data.&#x20;
