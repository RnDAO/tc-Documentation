# üìù Settings

The setting page lets you change what data should be extracted from your Discord. This does not change the settings of the charts. You can adapt three settings:

### Time period

Change how far back the data analysis should go. Choose between 7 days (the default), 1 month (1M), 3 months (3M), 6 months (6M), and 1 year (1Y).

By selecting a different range, you change what historical data will be included in the dashboard. To help you decide, you'll see what the starting point of the analysis is.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you change the date period or the channel selection, we'll need some time to collect the data. Be patient and wait for the new import to be done.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want the charts to show a different time frame, select the filtering button at the top right. That changes the visualization without impacting the data
{% endhint %}

### Channels

Under **change your imported channels** you can select or deselect the channels you want to include in the dashboard.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do you have role-gated channels? Give the bot permission to access them. Go to your server settings in Discord and add the corresponding roles to the bot. See [getting-set-up.md](getting-set-up.md "mention") for a walk-through.
{% endhint %}

## Integration

Here you can see your integrations. Right now you can only integrate the bot in one community. **Disconnect** the bot, if you want it to stop fetching data.

{% hint style="info" %}
Want to delete all your data from our database? Please reach out to us via our [support channels](../overview/support.md).
