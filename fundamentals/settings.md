# üìù Community Settings

The setting page lets you modify

* Name of your community
* Integrations
* Roles and Permissions



<details>

<summary>Your Community account</summary>

You can change the name of the community. This changes how your community is called on TogetherCrew.

By  selecting S**witch account** you can easily switch community account.&#x20;

Select **Delete community** if you want to remove your community from TogetherCrew.

<summary>Integrations</summary>

Here you can add or remove integrations. To add an integration select **+ Connect.**&#x20;

To remove an integration select the menu (three dots) at the top corner of the integration you like to remove and then select **Disconnect** on the top right.&#x20;

By selecting the menu (three dots at the top right of an integration card) you can also fine-tune the permissions for that integration by modifying the **time period** and **channel** access.



**Time period**

Change how far back the data analysis should go. Choose between 7 days (the default), 1 month (1M), 3 months (3M), 6 months (6M), and 1 year (1Y).

By selecting a different range, you change what historical data will be included in the dashboard. To help you decide, you'll see what the starting point of the analysis is.&#x20;

When you change the date period or the channel selection, we'll need some time to collect the data. Be patient and wait for the new import to be done.&#x20;

Our charts by default show you the last 7 days of data. If you want another timeframe, select the filtering button at the top right. That changes the visualization without impacting the data that we analyze.&#x20;



**Channels**

Under **change your imported channels** you can select or deselect the channels you want to include in the dashboard.

Do you have role-gated channels? Give the bot permission to access them. Go to your server settings in Discord and add the corresponding roles to the bot. See [getting-set-up.md](getting-set-up.md "mention") for a quick walk-through and [**Permission settings for Discord**](adding-platforms/permission-settings-for-discord.md) for more detailed info.





See [permission settings](adding-platforms/permission-settings-for-discord.md) for more information.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Roles and Permissions</summary>

You can give other people view or admin permission for the TogetherCrew community account.&#x20;

You can select members by either adding their username or their discord role. Keep in mind that admins can change the view and admin permissions. Admins will _not_ be able to

* remove themselves completely from the user permissions
* remove the person who created the community account on TogetherCrew

## Integration

Here you can see your integrations. Right now you can only integrate the bot in one community. **Disconnect** the bot, if you want it to stop fetching data.
