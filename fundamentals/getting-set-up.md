<summary>Step 2: Integrate your community</summary>

On the following screen, log in to Discord using your preferred method (email or scan the QR Code), and select the community. The bot will be automatically installed on your server.&#x20;

If you don't see your Discord community, you do not have the necessary permission to install the bot. Please contact your Discord server admin.

<summary>Step 3: Decide the time period and channels to use </summary>

Let's start with the fun part: Working with data. In this step you can select your time period and what channels to analyze. We suggest as a default time period one week and to use all channels.&#x20;

By default the bot does not have access to gated channels. Gated channels have a little lock symbol at the top right of the hashtag. To include these channels into your health metrics you need to do a couple of steps inside of Discord:

* Navigate to the channel you want to import on Discord&#x20;

<!---->

* Go to the settings for that specific channel (select the wheel on the right of the channel name)&#x20;

* Select Permissions (left sidebar), and then in the middle of the screen check Advanced permissions&#x20;
