<summary>Step 2: Add your community</summary>

On the following screen, log in to Discord using your preferred method (email or scan the QR Code), and select the community. The bot will be automatically installed on your server.&#x20;

If you don't see your Discord community, you do not have the necessary permission to install the bot. Please contact your Discord server admin.

<summary>Step 3: Decide the time period and channels to use </summary>

Let's start with the fun part: Working with data. In this step you can select your time period and what channels to analyze. We suggest as a default time period one month.&#x20;

By default the bot does not have access to gated channels. Gated channels are those channels in Discord for which members need a specific Discord tag. They have a little lock symbol at the top right of the hashtag. To include these channels into your analytics you need to give TogetherCrew read access in your Discord.

* Navigate to the channel you want to import on Discord&#x20;

<!---->

* Go to the settings for that specific channel (select the wheel on the right of the channel name)&#x20;

<!---->

* Select **Permissions** (left sidebar), and then in the middle of the screen check **Advanced permissions**&#x20;

<!---->

* Select the plus sign to the right of Roles/Members and under **members** select TogetherCrew bot, not TogetherCrew role.

<!---->

* With the TogetherCrew Bot selected, under Advanced Permissions, make sure that \[View channel] and \[Read message history] are marked as \[‚úì]&#x20;
