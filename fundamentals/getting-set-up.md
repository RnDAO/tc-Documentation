<summary>Step 3: Finish onboarding by fine-tuning TogetherCrew's access to your community</summary>

**Date Period**

The last step is to decide the access TogetherCrew should have in **Community Settings**. For Discord community we can analyze historical data. You have to decide how far back we should go. We suggest as a default time period _one month_.&#x20;

**Channel access**

By default the bot does not have access to gated channels. Gated channels are those channels in Discord for which members need a specific Discord tag. They have a little lock symbol at the top right of the hashtag. To include these channels into your analytics you need to give TogetherCrew read access in your Discord.

* Navigate to the channel you want to import on Discord&#x20;

<!---->

* Go to the settings for that specific channel (select the wheel on the right of the channel name)&#x20;

<!---->

* Select **Permissions** (left sidebar), and then in the middle of the screen check **Advanced permissions**&#x20;

<!---->

* Select the plus sign to the right of Roles/Members and under **members** select TogetherCrew bot.&#x20;

<!---->

* With the TogetherCrew Bot selected, under Advanced Permissions, make sure that \[View channel] and \[Read message history] are marked as \[‚úì]&#x20;
