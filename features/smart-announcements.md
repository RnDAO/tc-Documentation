**Step-by-step guide:**

1. Select Create Announcement&#x20;
2. Set the date and time it should be posted. This can be 30 minutes from now or several days in the future.
3. Decide in what channel the announcement should appear. If you see a warning next to the channel <mark style="color:red;">Bot needs access</mark> you first have to set the right permissions.
4. And finally write your message. If you use @-mentions this will show up in Discord and tag the respective people.

### How to set permissions for the Smart Announcements to work?

For the announcement to be posted, TogetherCrew bot needs _write_ access in that channel. By default to keep your community safe, our bot only has _read_ access to public channels.&#x20;

You can set write access to TogetherCrew at 3 levels, from broad (server) to fine-grained (channel)

1. Server: Permissions for every category and every channel
2. Category: Permissions for channels grouped into one category
3. Channel: Permissions for specific channels

If you have different permission settings for category and server, the server settings are overridden by the category settings. Similarly, channel level settings override category level settings.&#x20;

**How to set permissions**

1. Decide what access level you should grant. We recommend setting write access only for specific channels.&#x20;

In Discord:

1. Navigate to the settings for a specific channel (select the wheel on the right of the channel name)

1. Select ‚ÄúPermissions‚Äù (left sidebar), and then in the middle of the screen check Advanced permissions. You might have to scroll down a bit.
2. Check that TogetherCrew is in the list of Roles/Members that have access to the channel. If not, select the ‚äï and add it.
3. Now, select ‚ÄúTogetherCrew‚Äù and scroll down the list of  Advanced Permissions. Make sure that the following are marked as \[‚úì]
   * ‚ÄúRead‚Äù access settings: Read channel and Read Message History
   * For ‚ÄúWrite‚Äù access settings, the following is required
     * Send Message, Send Messages in Threads, Create Public Threads, Create Private Threads
     * If your announcement will include links, files and mentions, add these permissions: Embed Links, Attach Files, Mention @everyone, @here, and All Roles
4. Save your settings and go back to TogetherCrew

In TogetherCrew, Community Settings page give the bot access to the channel.

1. On the top right of your Discord server panel, select the menu (three dots)
