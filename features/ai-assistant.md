# AI Assistant

The AI assistant is your community's personal intern, never tired or grumpy helping you out. Members can ask it simple questions about your product, it can summarize key points of a conversation. You can also use it to help you prepare proposals and it will make it easier for you and your members to stay up to date on conversations. Watch the video below to learn how it works and how to set it up.

You have to activate the [AI assistant in your settings.](../fundamentals/setting-up-the-ai-assistant.md) Then, after 24 hours, it will be available for your users. You can set up the bot in any way you like. Give it liberate access for training and answering questions or restrict it. For example, you can give the bot access to all your channels for training, but only one channel for answering. Or give it access to only one channel for training (e.g, faq channel) but members can ask it question in all channels.

You can use the AI assistant like a Q\&A bot letting it answer questions your members are having, or integrate it in your workflow. You have to type `/question` and then type your question in the provided field.



Below are a list of **prompts** to help you get started

* How can I get access to channels?
* How can I get access to the faucet?
* What has the TogetherCrew team up to?
* I'm drafting a proposal on X. What has already been discussed on this topic
* Who is working on X?
* When is the onboarding call scheduled?



Keep in mind the following to get the most out of the AI assistant

* The AI assistant can only answer questions about topics that have been discussed in the channels it has access to.&#x20;
* The AI assistant only gives private answers. If you want to share the answers with others, you have to screenshot or copy-past it.
* The AI assistant messages are ephemeral answers. This means that after some time, the post will disappear.&#x20;



If you get the following error message, wait 10 seconds and then just give it another try.
