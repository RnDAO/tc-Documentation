# Onboarding new members

The member retention panel gives information about how successful your community is in attracting and integrating new members.&#x20;

Three metrics are displayed for new members:

* Joined: how many people joined per day in the last 7 days
* Newly active: how many people start building relationships with others within the past 7 days.&#x20;
* Still active: how many new joiners are active after a longer time period. More specifically, how many members were active in at least 2 out of the 3 weeks since they joined.&#x20;

\


As we make a difference between joining the server and interacting with members of the community, the number of newly active members can be higher or lower than the people who joined during a time period. A couple of examples:

* A person is only counted once, namely in the joined category if they do not interact with others. This could be because they do not post in the introduction channel or because they created  such an obvious promotional post that no regular community member wants to reply
* A person is counted twice, in the joined and newly active member category if (a) they join and (b) pretty soon have a back-and-forth with others.
* A person who joins, but does not introduce themselves for a month, is only counted as a joined member. Once that person interacts with others, the person is counted as a newly active member, but not anymore as a joined member.&#x20;

What can you learn from New members retention panel

* You can evaluate the impact of changes on the onboarding of a cohort of members.&#x20;
* How successful outreach activities are: What type of outreach activities attract people, and do they become and remain active in the community?
