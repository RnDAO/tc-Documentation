# ðŸ‘Ÿ Explainer: Community Activity Level

## Explainer: What do I see?

The chart shows you for every day in the week and every hour how many messages have been sent in your Discord community. The darker the shaded cell the more activity happened on that day at that time. You can quickly see patterns of light and dark. When it's light people are sleeping or away from your Discord community. When it's dark, members are present and are posting.

## Diagnose your Community

Use the heatmap, the activity chart, to figure out when members are checking out posts in your Discord and talking with others. If your community would meet in a physical place, like a club house, the dark shaded area tell you about rush hour. When the place is jam-packed.

Use the heatmap to figure out

* What events is your community attracted to?
* What is the daily rhythm of your community? Do you have early risers or night owls?
* Are certain times and days more popular for your community?
* If you are product/service DAO, check if there is sufficient time for deep work (low level of interactions between members)

## What does it not tell me?

The activity chart shows when people are talking with each other in a public channel. This means you

* don't know at what time members talk with each other using DMs
* should not assume that they can also be active on calls
* don't know which events get most people on-stage talking with each other

## What can I do?

* Post announcements when your community is most active on Discord.
* Schedule events when members are also on Discord.
