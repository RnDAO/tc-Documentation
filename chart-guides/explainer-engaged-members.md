# ðŸ‘¥ Explainer: Community Insights

The community insights page gives you information about your active and inactive members. Community members are grouped into different categories based on the number of conversation they have, and with how many people they interact. The different categories are explained in our [glossary](../overview/glossary.md).&#x20;



## Explainer: What do I see?

The page tells you how active your community is by looking at activity from different stages of the community member experience (onboarding, member, offboarding). For every aspect (e.g., onboarding), you'll see&#x20;

* A panel with the most recent numbers (_today's statistics_)
* A table with information about members and their corresponding activity status
* A line chart showing you the evolution of the member category

These are separated into active member and inactive (disengaged) members. For each subpage, you see several charts helping you to understand

* Is your onboarding flow successful in keeping members engaged? (_onboarding overview chart)_
* Does the community consistently provide value to its members (_active members chart, disengaged members chart_)
* Does your community provide ad-hoc value to its members (_returned members char)_

What can you learn from the Community Insight page
--------------------------------------------------

1. Do your outreach activities attract sufficient new members (joined members, onboarding overview chart)?&#x20;
2. Is your community successfully welcoming new members (newly active, onboarding overview chart) and integrating them (still active, onboarding overview chart)?
3. Are interactions sustained over time leading to strong relationships, the core building block of healthy communities (members over time)?
4. What member type is disengaging (disengaged members over time)? What is the rate of disengagement?
5. What type of community activity leads to members being more deeply engrained in the community (members over time)?
6. Who in your community is like a magnet, holding the community together (check who your vital members are in the members overview breakdown table)



## What can you not learn

1. You don't know why members are disengaging. Use your knowledge of your community to find out why this. Use the numbers as a warning system.
2. You don't know if the level of conversation is positive and adding value to the community. You just know the level of interaction. We are going to add sentiment analysis to provide more fine-grained insights.&#x20;
3. If your members seldomly use the Discord feature reply-to or mention, then the charts will underestimate the level of interaction.



### Learn more

Important here is to not only focus on the summary number for the selected time period, but pay attention to changes. Posting on Twitter about an event should attract new people, and some of these new people will be interested to stay in your community. Compare the number of joined members with the number of still active members to track the impact of community events and activities. \


You can also pay attention to spikes, sudden increases in numbers. But donâ€™t underestimate the importance of consistency and a steady flow, or increase of new members, and decrease of disengaged members.&#x20;
